### This is a FPS-type engine written in JAVA ###

Click "M" to activate map (minor animation and minor object)
Click on "Hand" to activate/deactivate flashlight (mouselistener)
WASD to move
RIGHT and LEFT arrows to rotate
NightmareBob and NightmareBob2 are the two major objects
Each 'column' of the raytracing engine is a minor object
The movement of each 'bob' is a major animation (two in total)
The movement of the columns in the raytracing render is a minor animation
ActionListener and KeyListener used instead of sound

I apologize for nightmares ahead of time ;D
