### This is a FPS-type engine written in JAVA ###

Click m to activate map (minor animation and minor object)
Click on hand to activate/deactivate flashlight (mouselistener)
wasd to move
right and left arrows to rotate
NightmareBob and NightmareBob2 are the two major objects
each 'column' of the raytracing engine is a minor object
the movement of each 'bob' is a major animation (two in total)
the movement of the columns in the raytracing render is a minor animation
actionlistener and keylistener used instead of sound

I apologize for nightmares ahead of time ;D
 
**also  the bobs are slightly buggy; i ran out of time when trying to fix their motion and clipping, so sometimes they might show through walls
